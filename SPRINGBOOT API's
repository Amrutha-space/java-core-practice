--DTOs, Validation, Exception Handling
Data transfer objects -it works as a bridge between data and backend.
validation uses keywords to write the packages 
exception handling handles the errors generated by the code and helps improve the code accuracy.

we need to create again the packages and java classes for those packages and write the code 
then run them in the IDE .


--- Response structure & error handling

I use PostMan for the API testing 
if you stop running your code in the IDE , it would probably didn't connect.
 you should always start running the code in the IDE then come to postman for testing .
It will precisely gives the output if the code and validation and DTO code blocks are correct and dependencies shpuld be without any error.
