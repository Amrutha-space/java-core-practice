# java-core-practice

I've showed interest in java as a part of my placement preparation. As I'm familiar with C++ , I know some concepts which would align with my previous knowledge og programming.
I share my progress of learning the JAVA Language and how it turns out for me.
During the preparation process, I will learn java and Spring boot from scratch and built some of my ideas which are staying in a net of my mind !!
