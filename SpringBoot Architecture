Don't write DB logic in Controller
don't call Repository directly from Controller
don't mix DTO & Entity carelessly

- Controller → calls Service
- Service → calls Repository
- Repository → talks to DB
We have to make sure that everything is connected and and to get the output the IDE is running
every repo has it's own class.

--- Pagination, Sorting, Filtering, API patterns
.Pagination (page, size)
.Sorting (sort=field,asc|desc)
.Filtering (query params like name, email, gender)

for every method you need to add the considerate code block to existing code 
we then nned to check whether the API is working or not 
POSTMAN will give result according to the data given and API searched.

--- API Testing
Postman + Unit Tests (JUnit basics)
