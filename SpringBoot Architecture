Don't write DB logic in Controller
don't call Repository directly from Controller
don't mix DTO & Entity carelessly

- Controller → calls Service
- Service → calls Repository
- Repository → talks to DB
We have to make sure that everything is connected and and to get the output the IDE is running
every repo has it's own class.
